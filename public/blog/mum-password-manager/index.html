  "articleBody": "A few weeks back, my mother (70-odd years old) was victim of a phishing attack. Smishing to be exact.\nShe got a text from what appeared to be the government, asking her to login to her account using her bank’s card reader. For anyone not familiar with the Belgian government’s authentication process, this is not uncommon. Turns out though that,on this occasion, this was somehow linked to a payment authorisation protocol and… well, she got scammed off a few thousand euros (!).\nFrightening, to say the least, for a person of that generation.\nBeing the good son I am (ahem) and edging on the border of paranoya when it comes to the online world, I took it upon me to give her a few pointers, for the next time.\nWe covered the basics:\nDon’t blindly follow instructions Just because an official-looking email tells you to do something, it does not mean you should do it! (Remember the good old “if he told you to jump from a window, would you?\")\nTake a second to think about why you are about to do what you are told to do. Does it make sense? If you’re not sure, double check with the authority in question (or even do a quick Google search DuckDuckGo search.)\nNote: Turns out she did do a quick online seach, after the facts. Guess what? The web was full of mentions of that scam (word to word transcripts of the exact same text message!)\nStay away from the link Here is a scenario. My bank sends me the message “To confirm your account, login through www.bank.com/account.\nNow hover over the link www.bank.com and look at where it leads; www.thisIsNotBank.com. (Confused? Click on the link above and check the web address of the site you land on)\nJust because the link appears to be pointing to a website you are used to, it does not mean it is the case! And, guess what? The bad bad people out there will make sure that the page you land on looks exaclty the same as the one you expect! (You won’t even notice you’re on the wrong site.)\nSo don’t be fooled by links. If you are told to login to your account (and you have good reason to do so), open a new tab on your browser and go to the website directly.\nIt is from a well known source, it must be safe The comon instinct is that, if the email comes from a brand I know (the bank, the government,…), it must be safe! Wrong!\nIt is because the email appears to come from a reputable source that you need to double-down on vigillance! In the online world, trust no-one, verify everything.\n Okay okay, this is dandy, we’ve read/heard all this before. But, what took me by surprise is the face that… she listened! And she appeared interested! So I took it upon me to introduce her to the concept of not re-using passwords.\n The risk “This time, it was money. That’s fine, the bank will probably (eventually) get it back to you. But what if it was your online account? Say someone stole your password through the same technique. Then what?\" (me to her)\nThe reality is that, if you are using the same password for all your accounts and you get phished (your password is compromised), then you are at the mercy of the bad bad guys out there. They get access to your insignificant account, then get into your inbox. From there, they can reset any account (Facebook, Instagram… your bank details, your official documents…)\nHow easy is your password to guess? Cracking a password (using software to try a hundreds of possibilities at a time until the right password is found) is not rocket science. It does not take that long to do so either (depending on the complexity of your password).\nNote: The password Password1234 is much easier to crack than NQ7y4!\u0026$pGPLeoYFk?h3.\nTake a look at the image below. How long would it take to find your password?\nHow to check if my credentials are out there? There is this cool website, Have I Been Pwned, that collects all the data from known databreaches and lets you check if your email or password are in there. Check for yourself!\n Okay, back to my mother.\n I use Dashlane as my password manager. One place where all my passwords are generated and stored. (They all look like this by the way: NQ7y4!\u0026$pGPLeoYFk?h3). When I go to login to any online account, Dashlane pop ups and offers to fill in my password. Dandy!\nSo, I went ahead and registered to a family pack and gave access to my mother.\nA first step Today, I spent an hour with her on a Zoom call (we live 934.69 km away from each other) and showed her how the password manager works (the browser plugin, the online portal, the app on the phone). We also installed the Chrome extension onto her laptop and added her first password ever.\nThat is all we did, for now. But it is a first step!\nNow every time she logs in, Dashlane is going to ask her to save the password.\nThe next steps After a while, she will have the majority of her passwords saved in the password manager and we will be able to see how many times she re-uses the same password, how many of them are weak, etc. We can then look at updating them with more robust, ugly-looking (but safe) ones.\nDo you want to find out more? If you are interested in this and are not sure how to get started, I am happy to spend some time and run you through the basic workings of a password manager. It won’t be long till you’re up and running! Just email me at hello@wedesign.ie.\n",
